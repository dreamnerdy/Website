## History

Dream Nerdy is an independent game development studio founded in early 2020. We are dedicated to developing games where we think about the gamer’s experience first.

We started development of OTCDG roughly a year ago and at that time there weren’t any other disc golf games available for PC (either VR or non-VR). Since that time, a few others have popped up and released. We believe we have the best contender by a longshot. We’re developing this game to be VR-first because we believe that there is something really magical about being fully immersed and lining up your shot like you do in the real life sport. Regardless, we think we’ve made the best Disc Golf game around whether it be VR or non-VR. This is not a tech demo, and not ‘just’ a simulator - this is a captivating game with a fun progression system and solid multiplayer features.

Why “Dream Nerdy”? Everyone is Nerdy about something - you’ve got a passion, and we think you should dream big with it.
