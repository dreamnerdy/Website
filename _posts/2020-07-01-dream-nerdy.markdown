Dream Nerdy is proud to announce the production of our indie game **Disc Golf, Off The Chains**, which will be an immersive light hearted Virtual Disc Golf experience. 

Please enjoy this mini teaser and stay tuned for development videos and updates.

As our first public game release, we expect to run into bumps and turns in creating the game you most desire. But we are dedicated to listening to all the feedback we can, and hope to be able to adjust when needed.

We will soon reach out for any interested Game Testers.
